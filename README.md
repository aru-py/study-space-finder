# Study Space Finder


## Overview
It’s sometimes difficult to find a quiet study space on Clemson University’s 
campus. This web app uses course registration data to find periods in which
campus classrooms are being unused, whether you just need a spot to unwind 
between classes or hours of uninterrupted silence. The goal of this project
was to help reduce overcrowding at Cooper Library, and after surveying 
hundreds of students, it was proposed to the university in March of 2020.

## Notes
Unfortunately, the university was not in a position to accept the proposal due to external factors, such as safety, that would have to be considered.
